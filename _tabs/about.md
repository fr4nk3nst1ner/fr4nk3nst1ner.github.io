Welcome to Taco Hacks! As a native Texan, I wanted to share some security ramblings with a southern twist. I have been in the Offensive Security industry for the past decade and have a permenently unquenched thirst for learning. As I learn some things, I try to share theme here in the unlikely event someone else might find them interesting. 

The goal of the content is for everything to be open source. Please don't hesitate to open a pull request or issue if you come across anything that might be inaccurate. 

Thanks for the visit!
